# Managing Aliases

In Azure AI Search, an index alias is a secondary name that can be used to refer to an index for querying, indexing, and other operations. You can create an alias that maps to a search index and substitute the alias name in places where you would otherwise reference an index name. An alias adds flexibility if you need to change which index your application is pointing to. Instead of updating the references in your application, you can just update the mapping for your alias.

To manage a search index alias in the Xperience administration, navigate to the Search application on the dashboard.
